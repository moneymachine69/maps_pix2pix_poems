        <p style = "background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); opacity: 0.8;">the process of image building as a machine fascinates me. <br>these generated images are not maps. they do not, nor will ever, function as maps in the traditional sense. they are instead indicators of a network and system that both <br>flattens and expands. </p>

      <p>i notice how much of machine generated images, videos, and realities are in service of self-driving cars. content is created as data for these cars, and the machines that run them.
    <br><i>(it is turtles all the way down)</i><br><br>
    to generate videos, like <a href = "https://youtu.be/3A3OuTdsPEk?t=209">dash-cam videos</a>, you predict typical scenes and patterns. you can then multiply the possibilities and train with them. to learn to generate a map, you learn how to make new ones by learning typicality, and respond to new landscapes. (that is the hope at least).</p>

      <p>within a map, the world is delineated into three colors<br><b> {urban: beige, forest: green, water:blue}</b><br>
        roads, the access points for cars, the place you <br>(the machine) can be, are white.</p>

      <p>cars do not need to run through the forest, or the ocean. in these world(s) that the cars live in, the forests are contained.<br> or they are <a href = "https://stopcop.city/">replaced with something that serves the cars</a>. <br>or they are simply gone.</p>

        <p>where do we fit in to the world of machines? 
            where do i fit, except, economically, as physician or trainer, realistically as fodder, and simply as a breeding ground for soft technologies of industry and control?<br>
            where do the forests fit in?</p>
